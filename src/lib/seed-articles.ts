    body: `Cannabis has come a long way from its days of stigma and prohibition. In 2026, more than half of US states have legalized recreational cannabis, and the industry has matured into a sophisticated market with diverse products, precise dosing, and scientific understanding of how different strains affect the body.

## What Is Cannabis?

Cannabis is a flowering plant that produces compounds called cannabinoids — the most well-known being THC (tetrahydrocannabinol) and CBD (cannabidiol). THC is the primary psychoactive compound that produces the "high," while CBD offers therapeutic benefits without significant psychoactive effects.

## Understanding Strains

Cannabis strains are broadly categorized into three types:

**Indica** strains tend to produce relaxing, sedating effects. They are often associated with body highs and are popular for evening use, pain relief, and sleep.

**Sativa** strains tend to produce uplifting, energizing effects. They are associated with cerebral highs and are popular for daytime use, creativity, and social activities.

**Hybrid** strains combine characteristics of both indica and sativa, offering balanced effects. Most modern strains are hybrids with varying ratios.

## Consumption Methods

There are several ways to consume cannabis, each with different onset times and duration:

- **Smoking** — Fast onset (minutes), duration 1-3 hours
- **Vaping** — Fast onset (minutes), potentially less harmful than smoking
- **Edibles** — Slow onset (30-90 minutes), longer duration (4-8 hours)
- **Tinctures** — Moderate onset (15-45 minutes), precise dosing
- **Topicals** — No psychoactive effects, localized relief

## Dosing Tips for Beginners

The golden rule of cannabis: **start low and go slow**. If you are new to cannabis:

1. Start with a low-THC strain (10-15% THC)
2. Take one or two small puffs if smoking/vaping
3. Start with 2.5-5mg if consuming edibles
4. Wait at least 2 hours before consuming more edibles
5. Stay hydrated and have snacks available
6. Consume in a comfortable, safe environment

## Legality

Cannabis laws vary significantly by state. Before purchasing or consuming cannabis, always check your local laws. Use our Is It Legal tool to quickly find out the rules in your state.

## Final Thoughts

Cannabis is a powerful plant with real benefits when used responsibly. Take your time learning about different strains, start with low doses, and always prioritize safety. Our tools are designed to help you navigate the cannabis world with confidence.`,

    title: "Indica vs Sativa vs Hybrid: What's the Real Difference?",
    excerpt: "Learn the actual differences between indica, sativa, and hybrid cannabis strains — and why the distinction is more nuanced than you think.",
    category: "Strains",
    tags: ["indica", "sativa", "hybrid", "strains"],
    author: "KushSavvy Team",
    publishedAt: "2026-01-12",
    relatedTools: ["strain-recommender", "strain-compare"],
    body: `The indica vs sativa debate is one of the oldest in cannabis culture. Walk into any dispensary and you will hear these terms used to categorize effects, but the science tells a more nuanced story.

## The Traditional View

Traditionally, cannabis has been divided into two subspecies:

**Indica** — Short, bushy plants with wide leaves, originating from the Hindu Kush mountains. Associated with relaxing, sedating body effects. The classic "couch-lock" experience.

**Sativa** — Tall, thin plants with narrow leaves, originating from equatorial regions. Associated with uplifting, energizing cerebral effects. The classic "head high."

**Hybrid** — Crosses of indica and sativa genetics, offering a blend of effects from both parents.

## What Science Actually Says

Modern cannabis research has revealed that the indica/sativa classification is more about plant morphology (physical appearance) than chemical composition or effects. The real drivers of a strain's effects are:

**Cannabinoids** — The ratio of THC to CBD and other minor cannabinoids (CBG, CBN, THCV) has a significant impact on the experience.

**Terpenes** — These aromatic compounds play a crucial role in the "entourage effect," modifying how cannabinoids interact with your body. Myrcene, for example, is associated with sedating effects, while limonene is linked to mood elevation.

**Your Biology** — Individual endocannabinoid system differences mean the same strain can affect different people in different ways.

## Why the Labels Still Matter

Despite the scientific caveats, indica/sativa/hybrid labels remain useful as a general guideline:

- They help dispensary staff quickly understand what type of experience you are looking for
- Many years of selective breeding have reinforced certain associations
- Most indica-labeled strains do tend to have higher myrcene content
- Most sativa-labeled strains do tend to have more uplifting terpene profiles

## The Better Way to Choose

Instead of relying solely on indica/sativa labels, consider:

1. **Terpene profile** — Check the dominant terpenes
2. **THC/CBD ratio** — Higher CBD ratios tend to be less intense
3. **Specific effects** — Look at reported effects from other users
4. **Your own experience** — Keep a journal of what works for you

## Bottom Line

Indica, sativa, and hybrid are useful starting points, but they are not the whole story. Pay attention to terpenes, cannabinoid ratios, and your own personal experience. Our Strain Recommender considers all these factors to give you personalized suggestions.`,

    body: `If you have ever wondered why two strains with the same THC level can produce wildly different effects, the answer lies in terpenes.

## What Are Terpenes?

Terpenes are aromatic compounds found in all plants, not just cannabis. They are responsible for the scent and flavor of everything from lavender to lemons to pine trees. In cannabis, over 200 different terpenes have been identified, though most strains are dominated by a handful.

## The Entourage Effect

Terpenes do not just provide aroma — they actively influence your cannabis experience through what researchers call the "entourage effect." This theory suggests that cannabinoids and terpenes work together synergistically, each modifying the effects of the others.

## Major Cannabis Terpenes

**Myrcene** — The most common terpene in cannabis. Earthy, musky aroma. Also found in mangoes and hops. Associated with sedating, relaxing effects. Dominant in many indica strains.

**Limonene** — Bright citrus aroma. Also found in lemons and oranges. Associated with mood elevation and stress relief. Dominant in many uplifting strains.

**Caryophyllene** — Spicy, peppery aroma. Also found in black pepper and cloves. Unique among terpenes because it directly activates CB2 cannabinoid receptors. Anti-inflammatory properties.

**Pinene** — Fresh pine aroma. Also found in pine needles and rosemary. Associated with alertness and may counteract some memory effects of THC.

**Linalool** — Floral, lavender aroma. Also found in lavender. Associated with calming, anti-anxiety effects.

**Terpinolene** — Complex floral-herbal aroma. Found in many popular sativa strains. Associated with uplifting effects.

## How to Use Terpene Knowledge

When choosing a strain, look at the terpene profile alongside the THC/CBD content:

- Want relaxation? Look for myrcene-dominant strains
- Want energy? Look for limonene or terpinolene-dominant strains
- Want pain relief? Look for caryophyllene-dominant strains
- Want calm without sedation? Look for linalool-dominant strains

## The Future of Terpenes

As cannabis science advances, expect to see more terpene-focused products and more precise labeling. Some dispensaries already provide full terpene profiles on their products, allowing consumers to make more informed choices.`,

    title: "How Long Do Edibles Take to Kick In? Everything You Need to Know",
    excerpt: "A complete guide to edible onset times, duration, and what factors affect how quickly you feel the effects.",
    category: "Edibles",
    tags: ["edibles", "dosing", "onset time"],
    author: "KushSavvy Team",
    publishedAt: "2026-01-05",
    relatedTools: ["edible-dosage-calculator"],
    body: `One of the most common mistakes people make with cannabis edibles is not waiting long enough for them to kick in. Understanding onset times is crucial for a safe, enjoyable experience.

## Why Edibles Take Longer

When you smoke or vape cannabis, THC enters your bloodstream through the lungs within minutes. Edibles take a completely different path — through your digestive system and liver. This process, called first-pass metabolism, converts delta-9 THC into 11-hydroxy-THC, which is actually more potent and longer-lasting.

## Typical Onset Times by Edible Type

- **Cannabis beverages**: 15-30 minutes (fastest edible onset)
- **Tinctures (sublingual)**: 15-45 minutes
- **Gummies**: 30-60 minutes
- **Chocolates**: 30-60 minutes
- **Baked goods**: 45-90 minutes
- **Capsules**: 45-90 minutes

## Factors That Affect Onset Time

**Metabolism** — Faster metabolism = faster onset. Younger, more active people tend to feel effects sooner.

**Stomach contents** — Taking edibles on an empty stomach leads to faster onset but potentially more intense effects. Eating a small meal before can lead to a more gradual, comfortable experience.

**Body composition** — THC is fat-soluble, so body fat percentage can influence absorption and duration.

**Tolerance** — Regular users may feel effects differently than newcomers.

## How Long Do Effects Last?

Edible effects typically last 4-8 hours, significantly longer than smoking or vaping:

- **Onset**: 30-90 minutes
- **Peak effects**: 1-4 hours after consumption
- **Total duration**: 4-8 hours
- **Residual effects**: Up to 12 hours for high doses

## The Golden Rule

**Start low, go slow.** Take your dose, set a timer for 2 hours, and resist the urge to take more. The number one cause of uncomfortable edible experiences is taking a second dose before the first one has fully kicked in.

## What If You Take Too Much

If you consume too much:
1. Stay calm — it will pass
2. Find a comfortable place
3. Stay hydrated
4. Try CBD — it may counteract some THC effects
5. Chew black peppercorns — the caryophyllene can help
6. Rest or sleep it off`,
